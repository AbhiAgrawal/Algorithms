    def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        dict=defaultdict(list)
        for s in strings:
            key=[] ###key is basically a list
            for i in range(1,len(s)):
                diff= (ord(s[i])-ord(s[i-1])+26)%26  ##this is to keep difference as positive.. ex: za
                key.append(str(diff)) ###keep appending.. make diff as string since finally will be joining using ','
            dict[",".join(key)].append(s)
        return dict.values()
