    ### very very important question and tricky in the sense you might miss the index calc

                ## below ona dn two calc is extrmemly imoportant
                one = s[l:r]### basically one from l to r-1 but in python and two from l+1 to r
                two = s[l+1:r+1]
                return one == one[::-1] or two == two[::-1]
