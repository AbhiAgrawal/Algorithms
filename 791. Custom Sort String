class Solution:
    ##very simple just create the counter.. start with order.. put them together and again go through counter and see which are missing.
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        counter = Counter(s)
        answer=[]
        for c in order:
            val = counter[c]
            if val > 0:
                answer.append(c*val)
                counter[c] = 0
        for key, val in counter.items():
            if val>0:
                answer.append(key*val)
        return "".join(answer)
